## Low Productivity and Margins in Construction

Construction productivity has actually declined in some markets since the 1990s as showed below.

Financial returns for contractors are often relatively low—and volatile and as activity is uncertain the average machine owner have under 50% utilization of their machines.

Activity is project based, and the contractors compete for the project that generate activity and need for machine capacity. This means that when some have a high need for capacity, others peers in the market have over capacity. Hence, there is a potential for improving productivity and financial returns on investments in equipment, by peer-to-peer rental.

To explore this, we asked ourselves;

1) How many machine owners are there in Norway, and how many machines do they typically have?

2) How are the market is disributed over the country?

3) What is the market potential for a machine owner, to rent out the machine while not used?

## The Norwegian Construction industry
We looked at 2004 Construction Companies in Norway, that collectively turn over **EUR 10 Billion** annual revenue. Out of these companies **1870** of them have ownes heavy equipment. They own a total of **31 386** machines, of different types as showed in the histogram below.

## How this market is distributed in Norway

The companies are distributed over the country, as showed below.

Where we see that most are concentrated in the middle of Norway, where we also see most of the machines are as well.

Projects comes in different sizes, where the smaller projects are regional whereas bigger ones are national.
