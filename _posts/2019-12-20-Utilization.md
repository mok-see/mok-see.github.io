## Low Productivity and Margins in Construction

Construction productivity has actually declined in some markets since the 1990s as showed below.

![Construction Labour Productivity](/assets/productivity.png)

Financial returns for contractors are often relatively low—and volatile and as activity is uncertain. Machine owners typically invest in equipment to handle high activity, but as the average contractor have under 50% utilization of their machines it shows that the optimal investment level could be lower.

Activity is project based, and the contractors compete for the project that generate activity and need for machine capacity. This means that when some have a high need for capacity, others peers in the market have over capacity. Data shows that a peer-to-peer rental market place could increase revenue in the industry with **EUR 1 Billion** and industry wide margins with a staggering **11 %**.

Let us walk you through this step by step, by answering the following questions;

1) How many machine owners are there in Norway, and how many machines do they typically have?

2) How are the market is disributed over the country?

3) What is the market potential for a machine owner, to rent out the machine while not used?

## The Norwegian Construction industry
We looked at 2004 Construction Companies in Norway, that collectively turn over **EUR 10 Billion** annual revenue. Out of these companies **1870** of them have ownes heavy equipment. They own a total of **31 386** machines, of different types as showed in the histogram below.

## How this market is distributed in Norway

Contractors typically are local, regional or national in Norway. It is correlated with their size, and the size is an indicator of which projects they can handle on their own. Local or regional projects are often also smaller than national ones. In our data set we have location of the companies, owning the machines. The companies are distributed over the country, as showed below.

![Number of Construction Companies per County](/assets/machine_owners_per_county.png)

Where we see that most are concentrated in the middle of Norway, in Trøndelag county. We also see that the the biggest companies (measured in Revenue) is concentrated in the middle, as showed below.

![Revenue per company per county ](/assets/revenue_per_company_per_county.png)

Bigger companies take on bigger projects, that might be crossing several counties, whereass smaller companies often take on smaller and regional/local projects. We also see that this correlate with how the amount of machines are distributed over the country.

These factors affects the market for peer-to-peer rental, as distance in transporting machines and resources will affect the ability and willingness to rent out machines.

When getting a functional market place for peer-to-peer rental, some actors might want to lean down and base themselves more on rental whereas others might chose to own more and supply machines for rental.

## What is the market potential for a machine owner, to rent out the machine while not used?

So, what are the potential for a machine owner to rent out their machines when not used? Is it something that could actually contribute significantly to their business?

In order to answer this we have looked into rental prices for heavy equipment in Norway. [Naboen](https://www.naboen.no/produktkategori/anleggsmaskiner/) is a rental company that has their rental prices online.

They rent out many of the most common categories that the companies in the data set owns. Through talking with industry professionals contractors often own bigger machines than what is possible to rent from typical rental companies. As we see on the Naboen page, rental prices within a category of machines is based on how heavy the machine is.

So based on this we have found an estimated average rental price per day. Based on this price the total daily peer-to-peer rental market these companies represent are; **EUR 14.78 Million**. With the daily revenue potential per type (that is listed on Naboen) is showed below.

Belt driven excavators has the highest potential, both because of high supply but also on high prices.

We know that the need for machines fluctuates for these machine owners as they have variable activity throughout the year. Utilization is of key concern, but is generally said to not be more than 40% ish percent on average. So we need to account for this when estimating the annual market potential.

In Norway the number of working days a year is 230 and with normal business requiring 40% of the machine capacity, it means 60% the machines are idle. We know that many times machines are kept idle for reasons like maintanance and planned downtime. In addition some machines are strategically kept idle - eg. you might need a Dozer everytime it is wet, but could make do with a cheeper to operate wheel loader when its not. Based on this we set the average availability for rental to 30% annually, which gives the following market potential for rental over the country.

![Annual rental potential per county](/assets/Annual_rental_tot_company_per_county.png)

The total annual market for peer-to-peer rental is estimated to be **EUR 1 Billion** and on average this accounts for a **11 %** of the current annual revenue for the companies.

The contribution of rental to revenue varies over the country, where interestingly enough the market where it has lowest percentage is for the middle of Norway (having most machines and biggest companies in revenue).

Here we see counties where rental potential accounts for 20% of the current Revenue.
