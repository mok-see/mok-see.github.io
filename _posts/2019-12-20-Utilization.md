## Low Productivity and Margins in Construction

Construction productivity has actually declined in some markets since the 1990s as showed below.

Financial returns for contractors are often relatively low—and volatile and as activity is uncertain the average machine owner have under 50% utilization of their machines.

Activity is project based, and the contractors compete for the project that generate activity and need for machine capacity. This means that when some have a high need for capacity, others peers in the market have over capacity. Hence, there is a potential for improving productivity and financial returns on investments in equipment, by peer-to-peer rental.

To explore this, we asked ourselves;

1) How many machine owners are there in Norway, and how many machines do they typically have?

2) How are the market is disributed over the country?

3) What is the market potential for a machine owner, to rent out the machine while not used?

## The Norwegian Construction industry
We looked at 2004 Construction Companies in Norway, that collectively turn over **EUR 10 Billion** annual revenue. Out of these companies **1870** of them have ownes heavy equipment. They own a total of **31 386** machines, of different types as showed in the histogram below.

## How this market is distributed in Norway

Contractors typically are local, regional or national in Norway. It is correlated with their size, and the size is an indicator of which projects they can handle on their own. Local or regional projects are often also smaller than national ones. In our data set we have location of the companies, owning the machines. The companies are distributed over the country, as showed below.

![Number of Construction Companies per County](/assets/machine_owners_per_county.png)

Where we see that most are concentrated in the middle of Norway, in Trøndelag county. We also see that the the biggest companies (measured in Revenue) is concentrated in the middle, as showed below.

![Revenue per company per county ](/assets/revenue_per_company_per_county.png)

Bigger companies take on bigger projects, that might be crossing several counties, whereass smaller companies often take on smaller and regional/local. We also see that this correlate with how the machines are distributed over the country.

These factors affects the market for peer-to-peer rental, as distance in transporting machines and resources will affect the ability to rent out machines.

When getting a functional market place for peer-to-peer rental, some actors might want to lean down and base themselves more on rental wheras others might be better of owning more and renting out more.
