## Using python to script buildings

Python is a widely used programming language that is many times called a glue language. It is heavily used from data science to fullstack applications.

Due to [Ifcopenshell](http://ifcopenshell.org/) and [pythonOCC](http://www.pythonocc.org/), and especially Thomas Krijnen with his [jupyterhub setup script with IfcOpenShell and PythonOCC modules](https://github.com/IfcOpenShell/ifcopenshell-jupyterhub), everyone could setup a notebook server to use python to script on their openBIM models like showed in the image below.
