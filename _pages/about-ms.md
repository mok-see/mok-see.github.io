# Uncertainty: Your Secret Weapon
>Most of all Design, is about creating the conditions by which businesses thrive, grow, and evolve in the face of uncertainty and change. As such, better businesses are ones that approach problems in new, systematic way, focusing more on **doing** rather than on planning and prediction. <cite>-- [Design A Better Business](https://designabetterbusiness.com) </cite>

So first of all, [mok-see] is the phonetic name of [moxie](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/moxie):  

noun Slang.
1. vigor; verve; pep.
2. courage and aggressiveness; nerve.
3. skill; know-how.

[mok-see] AS are both designing and redesigning of game-changing businesses, through starting new or leading change and innovation in existing businesses and organizations.

## Designer: A Rebel With A Cause

It is owned and lead by Sigve Pettersen, who is passionate entrepreneur thinking that "A little less conversation, a little more action please" will improve the world. As such, he is a "Rebel with a cause".

The cause is to work towards a sustainable built environment, through connecting technology, innovation, business and strategy.

This was the drive I had while co-founding Rendra AS back in 2012, bringing collaborative openBIM out of the barracks and into the field, with Rendra O (now called [StreamBIM](https://streambim.com/)).

The AECO industry, and your business, is filled with uncertainty. Digital technology and business models are transforming industries. Within this uncertainty exists innumerable opportunities to design (or redesign) game changing businesses. These opportunities are there for the taking, if you know how to look for them.

The Rebels Narrative is a blog where [mok-see] shares some thoughts on designing and developing better businesses for a sustainable built environment.
